# 🖥️ PC Builder API - Hardware Compatibility Engine

A REST API built with **.NET 10** utilizing **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles.

This project simulates the business rules engine behind a PC builder application. It enforces strict hardware compatibility validations (Sockets, RAM types, Power Consumption, PCIe bottlenecks) to ensure that the final build is both physically possible and optimized.
